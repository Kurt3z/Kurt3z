# Hello, I'm Tiago... 👍
## My name is Tiago Pinto and I'm 23 years old. 🖥️
### I'm from Porto, Portugal and I love computers since I was a kid. 🇵🇹
I am on a journey to learn Full Stack Web Development and trying to achive my goals and dreams of becoming a professional developer.
On my GitHub you can see everything that I'm working on. Every little project that I'm working and every practice that I'm doing to polish my skills
and developing myself into a proficient and self-sufficient programmer.
